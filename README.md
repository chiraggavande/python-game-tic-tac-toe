# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Tic Tac Toe" using Python's `turtle` module. 

## Game Rules

The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and each player takes turns marking a square with their symbol ('X' or 'O'). The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If no player has three in a row and the board is full, the game ends in a draw.

## Getting Started

To run this game on your computer, you need to have Python and the `turtle` module installed. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and you can install `turtle` using pip:

```
pip install turtle
```

After you have installed Python and `turtle`, you can download or clone this repository to your local machine.

## Running the Game

To run the game, simply run the `tictactoe.py` file:

```
python tictactoe.py
```

The game will open in a new window, and you can start playing by clicking on the squares you want to mark.
